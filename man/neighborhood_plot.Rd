\usage{
neighborhood_plot(adj, names = NULL, node, k, nod_col = "#E0EED4",
  nod_shading = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{numeric matrix representing the adjacency matrix. Can also be an
object of class \code{"igraph"} or an edge list, i.e., a two-column
\code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} containing specifying the edges start
and end points.}

\item{node}{optional character vector specifiying the node names.}

\item{k}{integer specifying the size of the neighborhood. Specifically,
the plot will contain all nodes that are \code{k} or fewer steps away
from \code{v}.}

\item{nod_col}{character vector of length 1 specifying the node colors.}

\item{\dots}{arguments to be passed to \link{graph_plot}.}

\item{node}{integer specifying the row index (within the adjacency
matrix) of the node whose the neighborhood should be plotted.
Alternatively the node name.}

\item{nod_shaing}{logical specifying whether the node colors should be shaded
as a function of the distance to \code{node}.}
}
\value{
nothing. A plot is created in \link{dev.cur}.
}
\description{
Plot k-Neighborhood of given node containing all nodes with distances
â‰¤ k from given node.
