The `memnet` package provides efficient implementations of network science tools to facilitate research into human (semantic) memory. In its current version, the package contains several methods to **infer networks from verbal fluency data**, various **network growth models**, diverse **(switcher-) random walk processes**, and tools to analyze and visualize networks.

The majority of `memnet` is written in C++ to deliver maximum performance.
